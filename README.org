*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*

Students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data life cycle within a particular domain. Focus will also be
on best software engineering practices and reproducible research.

- Go over  R and Python  for data science topics.
- Answer/help students on their project
- Go over some some topics as per students demands

* Grading
  There will be a final project and some coding homework assignments.

One has to do  a *project*  to full fill course requirements.
